# Gpa-calculator
The GPA calculator project revolves around creating a console application in C++ that calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) based on user input. This includes capturing the number of subjects or semesters, their respective credit hours, and grades, then applying the calculation to produce a result.
